<p><em>Customer Support Specialist</em></p>
            <h4><i>Summary</i></h4>
<p>I've been a Customer Support Specialist for about seven years now. I have experience both with individual and business clients.
    I mostly worked with English speaking customers from EMEA region and UK market. I also have experience in supporting Polish customers.<br><br>
    Since 2021 I've been learning how to code on my own. I mainly code in Python and learn how to analyse data with Pandas and PostgreSQL.
    Recently I started learning about web development so I know basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    <br><br>Privately: bedroom producer/beatmaker, vocalist/rapper, amateur musician,
    unpublished writer (but not always), occassional gamer, fan of movies, books, martial arts and Polish National Volleyball Team.
    I'd like to read more books and watch more movies but I constantly lack time to do this.
I try to find my first job in IT.</p></td>
